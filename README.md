- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @oriol81
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computers, technology and languages.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and all the stuff related to it (which I didn't think there were so many things).
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Soon I'll be sharing the links.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've watched GoT but my IG handle is not related to this, just a coincidence. It's my surname in German.
